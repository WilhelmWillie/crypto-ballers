# Crypto Ballers

Learning Solidity and Ethereum/Blockchain development! Inspired by the [cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io) tutorial, this project extends ideas from the initial lessons further.

I'm still tinkering and learning but below is my vision for what Crypto Ballers will be:

Crypto Ballers are randomly generated ERC-721 tokens that represent unique, individual, fictional basketball players. These ballers will have some information attached to them like
their preferred position and some offensive/defensive ratings (details TBD).

In "draft classes", new Crypto Ballers will be generated and released in batches of 100. Wallets can claim up to 5 Crypto Ballers to make up their roster.

Users/wallets can "release" Crypto Ballers into free agency, making that Baller free to pick up by anybody.

In a future V2, the following could be implemented:

- More refined Crypto Baller stats
- Roster battles and game simulations with real ETH at stake (ex: Alice proposes a matchup against Bob's roster. Their teams face each other and a winner is calculated via algorithm with some random-chance variance. Winner collects a certain amount of locked-up Ethereum)
- Decentralized marketplace for selling players
